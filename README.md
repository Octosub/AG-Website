# This is the README of the Acid Gakko webpage

I'm still in the process of getting the hang of everything related to webdev, so please excuse me for stumbling and falling sometimes. 
Right now I'm using git through the terminal in VS code for the first time to try and upload this website that I made locally to share it with my friend M. He is the first person to help me with my coding.  

This is the first ever website I tried making after starting to learn HTML and CSS. Looking back at it now, overall it's pretty bad. The design is awful, there is barely any functionality and even the code files and the media is organized horribly. 
But seeing the mistakes in my own creation and ways to make it better only means that I made some progress in understanding web development while creating this. So I'm excited to share this hot pile of garbage to mark the starting of my creating. 

Sincerely,
Octosub
