# README of the Acid Gakko webpage

This is the first page that I created to learn about HTML and CSS.
I'm also using git for the first time to try and upload this website so I can share it with my friend M. Thank you M for answering my noob questions.

Looking back at the creation of this page now, overall it's pretty bad. The design is awful, there is no interactivity and even the code files and the media is organized horribly. 
Still, I'm excited to see all the things that I have learned while creating this page and to share it. Maybe I'll keep adding functionality and update the page with the new stuff that I'll learn going forward.
